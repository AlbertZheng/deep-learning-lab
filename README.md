# Lab codes (WIP, but call for comments) of my Deep-Learning basic tutorials

This is code for labs covered in my Deep-Learning & Tensorflow & TensorLayer basic tutorials.

This is work in progress, and may have bugs. However, we call for your comments and pull requests. Check out our style guide line:

* More TF & TL (1.x) style: use more recent and decent TF APIs.
* More Pythonic: fully leverage the power of python
* Readability (over efficiency): Since it's for instruction purposes, we prefer *readability* over others.  
* Understandability (over everything): Understanding DL key concepts is the main goal of this code.
